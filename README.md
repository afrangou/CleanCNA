# CleanCNA
Subclonal copy number is called using Battenberg, DPClust takes Battenberg's output and clusters mutations by CCF. Metrics are calculated to assess the accuracy of the copy number call, adjusted purity (ρ) and ploidy (ψ) parameters are calculated if required, and the copy number profile is iteratively refitted where necessary.
